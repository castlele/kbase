## Notes

To develop adaptive communication
1. Evolve "one to one meetings" into something more powerful. Ask questions and listen to. Try to understand feelings, perspective, fears and motivation of your colleagues
2. Don't try to change mood of your companion. Acknowledgment of his emotions can work better and build more trust in you as a good leader. For example, it's better to say: "I understand your feelings", rather than: "Don't be sad"
3. Don't forget about self reflexion. It's usually a good practice to set goals for what you want to achieve and how want to be seen in the eyes of others before meetings. After meeting reflex on what you manage to achieve and what didn't work out. Find a list of tweak for future meetings
