# Right triangles

## Prerequisites

### Square roots

Rules:

- $\sqrt{x^2}=x$
- $(\sqrt{x})^2=x$
- $\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}=\sqrt{xy}$
- $\sqrt{\dfrac{x}{y}}=\dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}$

## Triangles

If triangle ABC is its angle A is right:

- sides AB and AC called is **legs** (катет)
- side BC called is **hypotenuse**

Legs can be also called in relation to the angle. For example in relation to the angle C:

- AC is called an **adjacent** leg (прилежащий катет)

- AB is called an **opposite** leg (противолежащий катет)

The Pythagorean theorem is $a^2+b^2=c^2$ where a and b is actually legs of the right triangle and c is a hypotenuse.

Sum of the angles in a triangle is equals to $180\degree$.

Trigonometric ratios are: sine, cosine and tangent:

Mnemonics for easy learn :) are **soh** ($\sin(\theta)=\dfrac{opp}{hyp}$), **cah** ($\cos(\theta)=\dfrac{adj}{hyp}$) and **toa** (byonicl lul) ($\tan(\theta)=\dfrac{opp}{adj}$)
