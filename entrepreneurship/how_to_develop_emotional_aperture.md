## Notes

How to develop emotional aperture:
- Journaling about team interactions and my own interpretations of them
- Interesting exercise for higher ranks (ðŸ¤£): on some meeting ask team to write down (anonymously or not) some things that drives and motivates them to do their work and some things that frustrates them. Take some time to collect a feedback and analyze it. After that share a common theme, talk about positives pain points. Be honest. People love being heard
- Sharpen aperture skills outside of the work team. Observe peoples relations ship in common situations. Notice nuances like body language, face expressions, silence. Try to pay attention to undertones
