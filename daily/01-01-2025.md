This year should be different in terms of goals. Right now it is so hard for me to live without strict frames. I need a goal, a source of light on the horizon. Right now I'm writing IDP for entrepreneur skills and I'm so confused, because how can I write something like this, if I don't know where I want to bring it. So this note I want to dedicate to my 2025 goals.

First of all, yes, right now I know where I want to go according to ![[goals.canvas|goals]]
To be clear its a becoming an entrepreneur in IT business, become very qualified software developer and become unique (or create unique things). To be honest right now I'm not sure about last point. Buy its ok, nobody disturb me from strive for it :)

Right now all three goals are similar to each other, because every goal also kinda works on other two. That is great! But this can be longterm goals without any result, so I need to set some goals for this year (or maybe less unpredictable period of time).

From the top of my mind this is should be achieved in 2025: 
1. become entrepreneur (even if this will be a failed experience) in startup (even if I decide to make (and actually make it) a solo product, it counts)
2. take part in 4 game jams
3. go through the entire devOps roadmap
4. create 10 small games
