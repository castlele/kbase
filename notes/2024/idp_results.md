1. Long term hard to measure goals/tasks got low level of priority and erased from the daily schedule
2. Small goals/tasks work perfectly giving real impact
3. Creating gantt is too expensive
4. A lot of fan in the IDP. This is good because I'm usually interested but bad cause it took too much attention
5. DevOps tasks got too much connections with uni. This causes dissonance in me, lowering the motivation
6. It makes sense to measure results after every task/goal
7. Every task goal should have its strong **WHY** otherwise I don't feel the impact on me
8. Google tables don't work. Cool graph is cool but useless to be honest
9. To experiment more ofter future IDP's should be for a shorter period of time (I'm guessing 1 month is ok)
