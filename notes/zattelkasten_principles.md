## Notes

**zattelkasten principles:**
- notes should be atomic
- notes should be self contained
- notes should be logically linked
- notes should be written with my own words
- two types of tags: inbox (for wip notes), green (for notes that are concrete)
- should be some rule to revisit abstract notes (when)
- should be rules to collect data from inbox into notes
- move everything possible from notes folder into kbase
- there is a need to create templates for notes
- 00- notes is a good idea to adopt
