Trainings kill creativity in me! Cardistry, cs became things to master (train) displacing creativity and fun! **Is this a case in my carrier?**

Buy yooo, this is so important to have a balance between creativeness and trainings. I have to to train enough (and not too much) before moving on!

A lot of thought today. Reimagination of my 2025 goals gone strange because from one perspective it changes everything, but from the other I just returned to where I've been in early 2024... 

I'm again in the place where I think that I have to make games to enter into game dev industry. However, right now the most important skills are an entrepreneurship ones and dev/devOps skills. Moreover, right now I'm in situation (first time ever) where I have a few people to work with on start up. This means that I partially have to follower their needs to have them in my staff. 

I want to start a lua/love2d project on this winter holidays to prove that there is an easy way to create crossplatform applications including mobile targets. This can lead me to the state where future start up of mine will be based on stupid mobile games :)

Sooo, this project is a VLC only for audio with statistics like in other streaming services at the end of the year. I will create a separate design document for it, but shortly I have to make a small mvp application that should work on mac/linux/windows/android/ios targets and all it has to do is to play music and show charts of the most popular songs in the media library in 3 weeks.
