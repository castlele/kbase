I still can't write bindings to `taglib` (library for managing tags/metadata on audio files). Sooo, for now I will only support flac, as I have library that works for me :)

This is pretty much unexpected, but okey, this c/cpp libraries peaces me off. 

Also, I still very much interested in writing notes and learning for entrepreneurship skills. Don't know why for now. May be because for now it's pretty easy and path is clear. Unfortunately, practice of all this skills will take a lot of my power and time. 

And one more interesting thought from tomorrow bed time. While I was reading the stoicism book unexpected thought appeared. I'm ready to read history books about ancient Rome. Right now I find this very fun.
