## Notes

>“Leaders need to be open to paradox”

Flexible thinking means don't be rigid in hard times. This means that leader should always seek for ambiguity and never be afraid of other/new opinions.

Moreover, as the research says people usually feel more relaxed when their leader says that he is open to new opinions. This leads to more effective communication with better results.
