## Little notes from business analysis practice:

The essence of every process is getting result from the resources you've got

Getting the essence of the business process is a process of determining of main components and characteristics of this process. This information helps to determine how this process works and how to improve and optimize it

Getting business processes steps:
- **Determine the goal of the process**. What task it solves and what is the result
- **Analyze the process**. Collect information about the process: participants, input and output data, resources, etc. Analyzing collected information and determining possible problems and improvements
- **Determine efficiency criteria (критерии эфективности)**. Define a performance evaluation (оценка) scale
- **Development of proposals for process improvement**. 
- **Integrate changes**.
- **Results evaluation**.

I've got awesome walk today. That was such a relaxing experience. I've drunk sea buckthorn tea (облепиховый чай lulW). And I've dream... dream about future about what could have been if only... I've done something great and got all possible luck in this world :)

I want to have a company. Game dev company. Hire some colleagues from MyOffice. And I want to create. I want to reach heights!

I've been thinking about money a lot. This is very important. To be honest, this is the major thing in all my dreams but while I was walking today I've got a good thought. This idea is'n new (even for me) but I always forget about it. 

> [!NOTE] What to pursuit 
>  "Try to become greater and you become reach".This isn't the rule obviously. But I strongly believe in this. I'm hoping to teach myself to seek for greatness and not wealth!

Also, I've got a good idea that can help me in the future. I have to check users amount on the games in steam (and other platforms too probably). And understand how much money I can potentially got from making a **good** game. This is very important, because I can plan how much strength and time I should invest in games.

Trainings kill creativity in me! Cardistry, cs became things to master (train) displacing creativity and fun! **Is this a case in my carrier?**

Buy yooo, this is so important to have a balance between creativeness and trainings. I have to to train enough (and not too much) before moving on!

A lot of thought today. Reimagination of my 2025 goals gone strange because from one perspective it changes everything, but from the other I just returned to where I've been in early 2024... 

I'm again in the place where I think that I have to make games to enter into game dev industry. However, right now the most important skills are an entrepreneurship ones and dev/devOps skills. Moreover, right now I'm in situation (first time ever) where I have a few people to work with on start up. This means that I partially have to follower their needs to have them in my staff. 

I want to start a lua/love2d project on this winter holidays to prove that there is an easy way to create crossplatform applications including mobile targets. This can lead me to the state where future start up of mine will be based on stupid mobile games :)

Sooo, this project is a VLC only for audio with statistics like in other streaming services at the end of the year. I will create a separate design document for it, but shortly I have to make a small mvp application that should work on mac/linux/windows/android/ios targets and all it has to do is to play music and show charts of the most popular songs in the media library in 3 weeks.
